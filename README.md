This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
-Jest is a testing tool from Facebook that makes it easy to perform unit testing in JavaScript.
-Normally, we’d need to install and configure Jest before writing any tests, but since create-react-app ships with Jest already installed, we don’t have to do any of that.

## This is simple React app-Jest-Testing
-how to test react components by using a jest testing framework.

## Features
- Jest Testing,
- SnapShot test
A typical snapshot test case for a react app renders a UI component, takes a snapshot then it checks against the reference snapshot file created by the jest if both snapshots don’t match our tests will fail.
